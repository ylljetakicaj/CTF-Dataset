CTF004,Soul Permutation Network,2021,Cryptography,Hard,,"This challenge involves a cryptographic scheme that encrypts 64-bit plaintext blocks using a custom substitution-permutation network (SPN). The encryption process includes multiple rounds of applying a substitution box (S-box), a permutation function, and a key XOR operation.

The objective is to reverse the encryption process or otherwise deduce the secret key by analyzing the provided plaintext-ciphertext pairs, allowing the recovery of the flag.","High. The challenge requires a deep understanding of SPN-based cryptographic schemes. The complexity arises from the non-standard S-box, permutation, and key schedule, which makes standard cryptanalysis techniques like differential cryptanalysis more challenging.","The encryption is based on a custom Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN).
The key schedule repeats portions of the original key across multiple rounds.

","Understand the Random Number Generator:

The Random class generates pseudorandom values based on a custom algorithm involving bitwise operations and rotations.
Sign Messages:

Use the sign function to create signatures for given messages using the custom random number generator and provided cryptographic parameters.
Verify Signatures:

Use the verify function to check if the signatures for messages are valid based on the custom random number generator and provided cryptographic parameters.
Retrieve the Flag:

The flag is read from flag.txt and used in the cryptographic calculations. If you need to solve this challenge, you would need to work with these cryptographic parameters and potentially reconstruct the flag based on provided values and algorithmic steps.

To use the solution script effectively:
Run the PyQt5 application.
Navigate to the target web page with hidden zero-width characters.
