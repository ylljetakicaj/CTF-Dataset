Quattro ambienti unici all’interno di una delle location più antiche e suggestive del centro di Napoli. 
Quatrum nasce dalla passione di due sorelle, Milly e Marianna di aprire la loro vita all’ospitalità nel cuore della loro Regione, all’interno di una vecchia dimora napoletana di fine 800 che ha rapito il loro cuore. 
L’obiettivo è stato quello di conservare intatti lo spirito e l’impeccabile fascino di una casa che racconta la storia di coloro che l’hanno abitata. Quatrum è identità, tradizione e ricerca dei dettagli.

Sono Giorgio, sono un giornalista, appassionato di basket e nuove tecnologie. Lavoro a Fanpage che, non per vantarci, ma è il giornale web più fico che c'è :) 
Sono di origini calabresi, ma veneto di adozione. Mi sono trasferito a Napoli per lavoro e mi sono innamorato. Cosa che credo capiterà a parecchi di voi se verrete a trovarci. 
Mi piace uscire e fare ogni tipo di attività ed esperienza. Sono socievole e curioso, libero e anticonformista, il mio artista preferito è Caravaggio e mi piace andare per musei e luoghi d'arte (capite perché ho accettato subito di trasferirmi qui?), antiproibizionista e in generale strenuo difensore dei diritti di tutti. Sto in fissa con Netflix, mi piace leggere romanzi gialli e saggi, cinema e teatro i miei hobby 
Ovviamente adoro viaggiare, ma mai da turista. Cerco di mettere insieme più giorni liberi possibile per poter avere il tempo di ""entrare"" il più possibile in una città, immaginando che in quel posto ci sia nato. Per questo motivo difficilmente scelgo l'hotel come sistemazione. Adoro cercare i ristoranti più tipici e provare le cucine più diverse, perché quella più buona ce l'ho sotto casa ;) Vivo nel regno della pizza, della pasta, dei dolci e dei piatti a base di pesce più famosi del mondo. What else?
La famiglia e gli amici sono quanto di più caro ho al mondo.

Impaziente di conoscervi di persona, ma non preoccupatevi, non verrò in vacanza con voi! Ma sarò lieto di trasmettervi l'amore per questa città accompagnandovi o segnalandovi i luoghi più affascinanti e le esperienze culinarie più travolgenti che si possono vivere qui!
